        <h1>Building your brand</h1>
        <p class="author"><span class="img" style="background-image:url(../assets/img/samsung.svg)"></span> by Samsung</p>
        <div class="cols cols2">
          <div class="col col1">
            <p>You might associate the word &lsquo;brand&rsquo; with a logo, design, name or  reputation; essentially a marker that separates one business from another.  However, too few people recognise the importance of building a positive brand  image. Be sure to establish your own unique brand identity from the offset, as  this will open you up to more professional opportunities and will help to make  business relationships more valuable. Remember: successful entrepreneurs have  great branding at the heart of their business. </p>
            <h2>Tone of Voice</h2>
            <p>Maintaining consistency across all your business communications is key, as  once people know who you are and begin to identify you with a specific area of  understanding or expertise, then you&rsquo;ll be on your way to becoming the go-to  person in your industry.</p>
            <p>Having a consistent tone will help build your brand but it&rsquo;s also essential  to make sure that it reflects your genuine values and passions. Essentially  your brand is a reflection of yourself so when setting the tone, ask yourself  what do you believe in? What do you stand for? What are your strengths and  weaknesses? Customers want to connect with genuine businesses so make sure your  branding is true to yourself.</p>
            <h2>Building Trust</h2>
            <p>As a starting point, setting the right tone for your company will put you  on the right path to building long term relationships with customers. However,  building trust takes time and lot of hard work. Focus on these three things:  service, reliability and honesty.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, great service will always matter to your customers,  so you can easily build trust here by ensuring you always deliver on your  promises. Then, make sure you don&rsquo;t just deliver on these promises once, but  continue to do so time and time again to provide consistency. And finally, be  honest: having a truly successful business is based on complete trust. Everyone  makes mistakes when they&rsquo;re starting out so don&rsquo;t be afraid to admit yours!</p>
            <h2>Moving with the times</h2>
            <p>It&rsquo;s becoming even harder to reach people as the market becomes more and  more crowded and your potential customers find themselves bombarded with so  many messages from so many different companies. Stand out from the crowd by  being innovative, bold and daring when building your brand; don&rsquo;t try to mimic  the look of others, but instead find your own unique voice that allows you to  shine through.</p>
            <p>But projecting a powerful personal image doesn&rsquo;t just happen on paper,  entrepreneurs also need to keep up with the fast paced world of technology and  build their profile through social networks and websites. When drawing up your  roadmap for future online brand-building efforts, be sure to consider what kind  of content will best serve your mission, how you will remain consistent across  the many internet platforms and the ways in which you will engage your  audience.</p>
            <p>Networking events; some of the most successful entrepreneurs started out by  attending at least 10 to 15 events per week. You need to get among people and  you need to meet as many as you can! Once you&rsquo;ve started to build up your  contacts, then don&rsquo;t forget to keep in touch to make sure the relationship  stays alive.</p>
