            <p>In a world of endless online videos to  watch, it doesn&rsquo;t take long before people get bored, distracted or simply find  something else to watch, so as a business you need to be doing everything you  can to hold their attention. What&rsquo;s more, customers are now not only taking to  social media to learn more about your brand, but also to see what others are  saying about you. We&rsquo;ve compiled our top dos and don&rsquo;ts for a positive social  media experience to help entrepreneurs succeed. </p>
            <h2>Be  yourself</h2>
            <p>              Social media shouldn&rsquo;t be a smokescreen  for you to hide behind. Start by understanding your identity, your brand&rsquo;s  identity and the voice of who is speaking across all your social media  platforms. Relationships with your customers grow best when they&rsquo;re honest. </p>
            <h2>Consistency  is key</h2>
            <p>            A consistent approach to social media is  key to getting started. Start by posting an image at the same time every day  and find themes for specific days or events. And remember the hashtag  etiquette: keep them short, keep them relevant and keep reusing them!  Consistency will also mean people know when to look out for your content, be  that a deal on a Monday, a great picture on a Thursday or a re-tweet  competition every Friday.</p>
            <h2>Plan,  plan, plan</h2>
            <p>            Planning is key to maintaining an  effective social media strategy. Whilst it&rsquo;s fine to keep an element of  spontaneity for those on-the-go moments and to keep things fresh, it&rsquo;s  important to plan the bulk of your posts in advance. This ensures you always  have something to say, that you&rsquo;ve given the bulk of your content some thought  and have made it as compelling as possible. In order to reach the most people  possible, the best time of day to post is lunchtime from Monday to Thursday,  which is when people take a break and check into their social media accounts. </p>
            <h2>Be  part of the #conversation</h2>
            <p>            Stay relevant as a brand by jumping on the  news agenda using trending hashtags, as well as posting content linked to  weekly hashtags such as #MondayMotivation, #ThrowbackThursday and  #FollowFriday. Better still, why not create your own branded hashtag like  KitKat&rsquo;s #HaveaBreak, which has resulted in lots of authentic images of the community  enjoying their product? Getting your hashtags right will help you stay current,  engage your community and grow your follower base: win, win.</p>
            <h2>Pictures  tell a thousand words</h2>
            <p>            When creating engaging content for your  platform, posting images or video is one of the key ways to help drive more  engagement and traffic. Remember that your images must appeal directly to your  target audience. Share advice, offer quick tips, or tell people your favourite  quote, and of course, don&rsquo;t forget to tag them with a memorable hashtag.</p>
