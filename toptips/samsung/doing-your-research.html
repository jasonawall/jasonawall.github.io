            <p>Starting your own business can be like building a house of cards; it requires a lot of patience and dedication, and sometimes you may feel like it’s about to all topple over. Doing your research is key to helping you build a successful business plan and brand, and to enable you to turn a great idea into a great business. </p>

            <h2>Finding the perfect business idea</h2>
            <p>You know you want to start a business, but where exactly do you start? For  some, the idea has always been there, it&rsquo;s just about getting started, but many  people fall at the first hurdle: finding the perfect business idea. Look at  what makes you tick. If you&rsquo;re going to start up a business, it&rsquo;s better if  there is something about it that you love, so you have the motivation to pursue  it. Ask yourself what do you enjoy? What are your passions? What are you really  good at? Can you find a way to turn these into a viable business?</p>
<h2>Research, research, research…</h2>
            <p>Somewhere between scribbling your idea on a restaurant napkin and actually turning  it into a fully functioning business, market research will form an important  part of your preparation and business planning. Being informed and knowing your  market will put you in a position of strength, help stop your business idea  from crashing at the first hurdle and more importantly, will help you to keep  your business goals on track.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s a wealth of information and insights out there; as a starting point  you can contact industry associations and business schools, read media  publications and sites, spend time online absorbing the breadth of information  the internet has to offer and attend trade shows and conferences. You want to gain  a sense of the type of customer your product or service will serve and what  makes them tick. Customers may ultimately like your product, but market  research will enable you to determine whether it&rsquo;s something they really need.</p>
<h2>And then insights, insights insights…</h2>
            <p>Your market research will have undoubtedly uncovered the main competitors  to your business, but make time to find out what they&rsquo;re up to – there&rsquo;s no  harm in becoming a customer to the competition! Ask yourself what are they  doing that you could do differently, or better. Moreover, many products or  services can fail because of unknown requirements and costs, so spend time  talking to experts in your markets and listen out for these hidden challenges.          </p>
