            <p>If there&rsquo;s a business idea that stays with you that you&rsquo;re seriously  passionate about, then there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t turn that dream into a  reality. Positive thinking can go a long way to actually getting started, as  one of the biggest hurdles people can face is a lack of self-belief – it&rsquo;s very  easy to convince yourself that you can&rsquo;t do it! The first step is often the  hardest but once you&rsquo;re on that path, you need to start thinking about what  your brand stands for and how you communicate that to your customers. And the  rewards will be worth it! Samsung research shows that senior decision makers in  small businesses believe those who have turned their passions into pay checks  have increased job satisfaction (84%), increased creativity (63%) and improved  focus at work (59%) as a result of pursuing their passions.</p>
            <p>Most entrepreneurs love what they do and as a result, have pushed  themselves, put in the hard graft and turned an initial concept into a great  product or service for others to enjoy. As you begin to develop your idea into  a business venture, think about how your passion runs through your brand story.  How does it make your business interesting and different and why should your  customers care? </p>
            <h2>Personal passions</h2>
            <p>              Reflect on your life experiences, characteristics and interests, and  consider how these will shine through in the business and form part of your  brand story. How does this make your business unique? The more you can weave in  your personal passion and story, the more authentic and compelling your  business will be and the more impact you will have in your market. </p>
            <h2>What does your business stand for?</h2>
            <p>When asked how to define their brand, many start-ups struggle to define who  they really are and what their businesses truly stand for. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to  define your purpose for the fear of alienating others – make sure your passion  shines through and embed it in your company DNA, as these values serve as the  foundation of your brand identity and set you apart from everyone else.  </p>
            <p>Think about it now. Would you be able to answer the following questions if  put on the spot?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What  does your business stand for?</li>
              <li>What benefits does your product or service  provide?</li>
              <li>What  do you want to be known for?            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Remember: defining your brand will help grow your business through  awareness and confidence. Ultimately to help create a loyal customer base, you  want them to share your passion and feel a connection to your product or  service. The best way to do this is to ensure your business clearly stands for  something and that your passion is clearly communicated.</p>
            <h2>The perfect elevator pitch</h2>
            <p>Devising a compelling elevator pitch is a challenge every entrepreneur must  overcome. Convincing potential shareholders to listen to you is no easy feat so  you need to be able to sell your idea in a couple of sentences, remember: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Keep  it short and sweet – Can you communicate your pitch in less than sixty seconds? </li>
              <li>Easy peasy – Don&rsquo;t confuse your audience,  because once they&rsquo;re lost, it&rsquo;s impossible to bring them back! </li>
              <li>One-liners – organise your pitch into a few  key selling points to hit all the important points. Make every word count.</li>
              <li>Question time – the elevator pitch should be  a conversation between you and a prospective investor so it&rsquo;s crucial to invite  follow-up questions from them.</li>
              <li>Make  the ask – Don&rsquo;t be afraid to invite your potential investors to take action. Ask  for a follow-up call or appointment to ensure you keep the conversation moving  forward.            </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Being your own brand ambassador</h2>
            <p>When your idea is finally beginning to resemble a stable business model and  you&rsquo;ve delivered the perfect elevator pitch to prospective investors, make sure  that marketing your brand doesn&rsquo;t become an afterthought. Get out there and  meet your future customers and employees, as the best way for a small business  owner to be a brand ambassador is to do what they say they&rsquo;ll do and deliver an  exceptional product or service that meets a need. Only you are responsible for  making sure that your brand&rsquo;s reputation stays intact. Live and breathe your  brand, think critically and continue to evaluate and re-evaluate consistently,  in order to keep surprising and delighting your customers. </p>
