            <p>Social media has been the very foundation of building my business as  well as my personal brand. As a journalist by background, Twitter has always  been my go-to resource for news and insights, but Instagram is also playing a  growing role in terms of engagement with our readers. On top of that, one of  our strongest plays in this space is via a private Facebook group under the  #FashMash banner. Our audience – largely comprised of those working in the  digital marketing space at fashion and luxury brands – is posting on this every  day; sharing insights on the industry, debating best practice, asking their  contemporaries for tips and contacts, and more. We use it to share stories from  our site, ask our own questions when researching audience needs and to recruit  attendees for our real–world events. It&rsquo;s an incredibly engaged community,  which has served us very well. </p>
            <p>I think we&rsquo;re the perfect example of quality over quantity with our  social media presence as a result – we don&rsquo;t have enormous reach, but the niche  that we operate in is so specific that when we do have engagement it really  does go a long way. </p>
            <p>We have always operated on the basis of authenticity – we&rsquo;re real and  we&rsquo;re genuine. We&rsquo;re not just pushing what we do to turn a profit, we&rsquo;re  sharing content that we know our audience wants and needs. My number one rule  for social media (on any channel) ties to that – post content that you yourself  would want to read. Even in a B2B world, which we&rsquo;re in, the most successful  content is that which connects with humanity in some way or another. If you put  anything through that filter, based on the idea of it being both authentic to  your brand and relevant to your customer, it&rsquo;s more likely to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
