    <li>When starting your own business, it is vital that you prepare yourself and be ready to toughen up. From start to finish, your first business attempts are likely to be a big learning curve and you have to be prepared for things to not go as planned. So instead of taking things that don&rsquo;t go well to heart, toughen up and learn to respond to problems with flexibility and solutions.<u></u></li>
    <li>When developing your business model, you should always be prepared to listen to your critics. I ensure that I read everything written about me, this keeps me grounded and helps me knock off any rough edges around ideas or existing projects that I am working on. One snarly comment below the line on a Guardian article doesn't have an impact, but if 10 people are saying the same thing, it's time to step back and see what I could be doing better.</li>
    <li>One of the most important things when starting a business is to fully believe in yourself and whatever crazy idea or ideas you may have come up with. Starting your own business is a leap off a cliff edge, and there is absolutely no guarantee of success. People will be sure to doubt you and tell you that you're crazy. When faced with this situation, simply own it. At the end of the day this is a massive adventure, and you will learn a lot about yourself with whatever obstacle or challenge is presented. <u></u> </li>
    <li>Before you get started, make sure your diary is completely clear. Starting a new business will consume you, so make sure you have time to chill out with family and friends as well as focusing on your business – physically pencil social hours into your diary! Personally, I achieve more the day after a pizza and movie night with my friends than I would have done working alone into the night.</li>
